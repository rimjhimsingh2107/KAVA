## 🎬 **PRESENTATION SCRIPT (7-8 minutes)**

### **SLIDE 1: Title (15 seconds)**
> "Good morning/afternoon! I'm presenting KAVA - an AI-powered insurance claims validation system."

---

### **SLIDE 2: The Problem (45 seconds)**
> "The insurance industry faces a massive challenge. Processing a single claim takes 2-6 weeks on average. Claims adjusters manually review hundreds of documents, validate receipts, and check compliance against complex regulations."
>
> "This manual process is slow, error-prone, and expensive. Fraud costs the industry over $80 billion annually. And 30% of claims need resubmission due to missing documentation."
>
> "What if we could automate this entire process using AI?"

---

### **SLIDE 3: The Solution (1 minute)**
> "KAVA solves this with AI-powered automation."
>
> "It uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 - one of the most advanced AI models - for document analysis and validation. The system processes complete claims in under 2 minutes."
>
> "KAVA evaluates claims against a 47-rule constitution covering everything from document completeness to fraud detection. It runs a progressive improvement loop that actually enhances claims by auto-fetching missing receipts."
>
> "Finally, it generates cryptographic proof cards with ECDSA signatures for blockchain verification - creating a tamper-proof audit trail."

---

### **SLIDE 4: System Architecture (45 seconds)**
> "KAVA is a full-stack system with three main components:"
>
> "The frontend is built with Next.js and TypeScript, providing a clean 4-step wizard interface for claim submission."
>
> "The backend uses FastAPI and Python, orchestrating document processing, AI validation, and output generation."
>
> "The AI services layer integrates Claude Vision API for OCR, our custom AI Judge for validation, and Knot API for automatic receipt fetching."
>
> "Everything is tied together with SQLite for persistence and ReportLab for professional PDF generation."

---

### **SLIDE 5: User Journey (1 minute)**
> "Let me walk you through the user experience."
>
> "Step 1: Upload documents. Users drop in photos of damage, receipts, insurance policy, fire department reports - whatever they have. Claude Vision API immediately starts processing each document with OCR, extracting amounts, dates, and damage descriptions."
>
> "Step 2: Create claim packet. Users fill in basic information like policy number and incident date. The system generates an initial organized claim packet PDF."
>
> "Step 3: This is where the magic happens - the AI Judge validation loop. The system runs up to 4 iterations, progressively improving the claim."
>
> "Step 4: Generate outputs. KAVA creates a complete submission-ready package with 9 professional PDFs, a validation report, and a cryptographic proof card."

---

### **SLIDE 6: AI Judge Engine (1 minute 30 seconds)** ⭐
> "The AI Judge is the brain of KAVA. Let me explain how it works."
>
> "We built a 47-rule constitution based on actual wildfire insurance requirements. These rules are organized into 7 categories:"
>
> "Completeness rules check for required documentation - photos, receipts, timelines. These carry 45% of the total weight because complete documentation is crucial."
>
> "Damage assessment rules verify the damage is actually from a wildfire and amounts are reasonable. These are 28% of the weight."
>
> "Documentation quality, timing, geography, policy compliance, and financial validation make up the rest."
>
> "The validation runs in 4 progressive iterations:"
>
> "**Iteration 1** does basic screening with the documents they uploaded - typically scores around 53%."
>
> "**Iteration 2** is where we get smart. The system automatically fetches additional receipts from Home Depot, Amazon, and Walmart using Knot API. This typically boosts the score to 74%."
>
> "**Iteration 3** reprocesses documents for better OCR quality. Usually hits 81%."
>
> "**Iteration 4** does a final expert review. The system stops early if we hit 80% - our approval threshold."

---

### **SLIDE 7: Live Demo Results (1 minute)** 🎬
> "Let me show you results from a real test claim."
>
> "I submitted 6 documents for a wildfire claim - a kitchen fire damage photo, two purchase receipts, an insurance policy, a fire department report, and a contractor estimate."
>
> "The system processed everything in 67 seconds total."
>
> "In Iteration 1, the baseline screening passed 25 out of 47 rules - 53% score."
>
> "In Iteration 2, KAVA automatically fetched 6 additional receipts from retail APIs and the score jumped to 74% with 35 rules passing."
>
> "In Iteration 3, after deep OCR reprocessing, we hit 81% with 38 rules passing. The system stopped here because it reached the 80% approval threshold."
>
> "The final output was a complete ZIP package with 9 professional PDFs, an itemized inventory showing $116,713 in documented damages, and a cryptographic proof card with our Silver Trust badge."

---

### **SLIDE 8: Technical Innovation (45 seconds)**
> "What makes KAVA special is that everything is real - not mock data or demonstrations."
>
> "We're using actual Claude Sonnet 4.5 API calls for OCR and validation. The system makes real decisions based on document content, not pre-programmed responses."
>
> "The progressive improvement is unique - most systems just validate what you give them. KAVA actively enhances claims by finding and adding missing receipts."
>
> "And the cryptographic attestation provides blockchain-ready proof that can't be tampered with - creating a permanent, verifiable audit trail."

---

### **SLIDE 9: Key Algorithms (1 minute)**
> "Let me explain how the key calculations work."
>
> "The score is simple: rules passed divided by total rules. If a claim passes 38 out of 47 rules, that's 80.85%."
>
> "But the weighting matters. High-importance rules like 'wildfire causation' carry 20% weight. Lower importance rules might only be 5%. So passing critical rules has more impact on the final score."
>
> "For value extraction from receipts, Claude's OCR returns a list of all amounts found in the document. We intelligently take the last value, which is almost always the total."
>
> "The itemized inventory then sums everything: $1,073 for the washer plus $289 for safety supplies plus $115,350 for contractor work equals $116,713.24 in documented damages."
>
> "All of this happens automatically with zero manual data entry."

---

### **SLIDE 10: Generated Outputs (30 seconds)**
> "KAVA generates a complete submission-ready package that exceeds industry standards."
>
> "You get 9 professional PDFs organized like a real insurance submission. The cover letter, official proof of loss, damage photos with the actual images embedded, an itemized inventory with every purchase documented, compiled receipts, fire department reports, contractor estimates, our AI validation report, and a cryptographic proof card."
>
> "This is everything a claims adjuster needs in one organized package."

---

### **SLIDE 11: Tech Stack (30 seconds)**
> "We built KAVA with modern, production-ready technologies."
>
> "Frontend uses Next.js 15 with TypeScript for type safety. Backend is FastAPI - one of the fastest Python frameworks. Claude AI powers all the intelligence. ReportLab generates professional PDFs. And cryptography libraries handle the ECDSA signatures."
>
> "Everything is containerizable and ready for cloud deployment."

---

### **SLIDE 12: Business Impact (45 seconds)**
> "The impact is significant."
>
> "We're talking about 95% faster processing - from weeks to minutes. That's a game-changer for customer satisfaction."
>
> "Automated fraud detection reduces risk and saves millions. The 80%+ accuracy means fewer errors and faster payouts."
>
> "By automatically identifying missing documents upfront, we drastically reduce the resubmission rate - saving time for both customers and adjusters."
>
> "And the blockchain-verifiable proof provides compliance and audit trails that regulators love."

---

### **SLIDE 13: Thank You (15 seconds)**
> "Thank you! Happy to take questions."
>
> "The code is open source on GitHub at github.com/rimjhimsingh2107/KAVA"

## 🎯 **ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

**Q: "Is the AI making the final approval decision?"**
> "KAVA provides a recommendation score. Claims above 80% are flagged for fast-track approval, but a human adjuster still makes the final call. KAVA is an assistant, not a replacement."

**Q: "What if someone tries to game the system?"**
> "We have 15 fraud indicators built-in - things like suspicious timing, inconsistent damage descriptions, and unusual purchase patterns. Plus, the cryptographic proof creates an immutable audit trail of the AI's reasoning."

**Q: "How accurate is the OCR?"**
> "Claude Vision API typically achieves 85-95% accuracy on clear documents. We even reprocess low-confidence documents in iteration 3 to improve accuracy further."

**Q: "Can it handle other types of claims besides wildfire?"**
> "Absolutely! The rule constitution is modular. We could create rule sets for flood damage, theft, water damage - any type of insurance claim. The core engine is claim-agnostic."

**Q: "What's the cost to run this?"**
> "Claude API costs about $0.15-0.30 per claim depending on document count. Compared to hours of adjuster time at $50-100/hour, the ROI is massive."

**Q: "Is this production-ready?"**
> "Yes! We have database persistence, error handling, proper logging, and everything is containerized. It's ready to deploy to AWS, GCP, or Azure."
